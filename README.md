# HSSH 
> An heply utility to easily search and connect into the heply servers

## Dependencies
Hssh has the following dependencies:
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)


## Install
Two methods are available:

### Manual
Clone the repository and then copy the binary file into a valid executable path. (Check your PATH env)
The binary is included into:

- `bin/linux/hssh` if you have linux
- `bin/macos/hssh` if you have MacOS

### Brew
Due to private nature of the repository, you must create first a personal access token
in gitlab settings tab. Copy the generated token and then export your env in your local machine

`export GITLAB_HOMEBREW_TOKEN=<Your Token>`

After that execute the following commands

```
brew tap heply/tools git@gitlab.com:Casval/homebrew-heply.git
brew install hssh
```

#### Notes

Hssh is written in go lang, so if you have a different system you can try to compile your own binary running
the golang build command like:
`go build <path to your file>`

## Configuration
You must set the following params in your configuration file.
The config file can be in `/etc/hssh/config` and can be overwritten 
from `~/.config/hssh/config`

- `GITLAB_BASE_URL` the gitlab api
- `GITLAB_PRIVATE_TOKEN` The private token use to auth in gitlab. Note this can be used for the `GITLAB_HOMEBREW_TOKEN`
- `GITLAB_PROJECT_ID` The ID of the repository where to fetch configuration files
- `GITLAB_FILES` The path of configuration files separated by comma

## Usage
To see available options and usage run:
